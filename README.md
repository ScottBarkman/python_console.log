# python_console.log
Its about time that python got a console.log

For years, JavaScript developers have had a one up on Python. They've been able to print whatever they like to the console using the infamous `console.log` command. It's about time python had this killer functionality. I've managed to replicate this behavior using state of the art python class(es).

## Usage
```
from console import console

console.log('debug message!')

console.debug('Is this working?')
```

### What's Next? 

- Unit Tests
- Other method functionality
- Travis CI Integration
- PyPi submission
